## A repo made to study Distributed systems study using Go

I've created this repo to post some experiments about distributed systems while I study the topic. Feel free to reach out to ask anything about the projects here! The ideia is to post projects along the way and also notes about what I did or what I'm doing. So far this is the list of labs that I've done (WIP):

- [Simple MapReduce](https://github.com/Massakera/distributed-systems-labs/tree/main/MapReduce)

For the future:
 - Make a simple tutorial for each lab, to guide who wants to build from zero.
